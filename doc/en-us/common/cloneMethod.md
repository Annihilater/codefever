# HTTP(S) or SSH?

When cloning a repository to the local, you generally encounter the problem of choosing to use HTTPS or SSH to connect to the remote repository. CodeFever also provides these two methods for users to choose.

The advantage of the SSH method is that after the user has set the SSH Key in the personal settings of CodeFever, there is no need to perform any manual authentication every time the user uses SSH to connect to the remote repository. However, the use of SSH has certain requirements for the user, and the user must generate the SSH Key and complete the configuration.

In contrast, the HTTPS method is more suitable for novices and users who are not familiar with the operating system, and there is no need to generate and set an SSH Key. However, when using HTTPS to connect to a remote repository, you need to enter your email address and password for identity authentication each time you connect.
