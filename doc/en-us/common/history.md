# How to retroactively modify files?

CodeFever provides two ways to trace file modification, namely **History** and **Blame**.

**History**: Refers to a list of all the change records of a file from its creation to its current state.

**Blame**: Refers to who edited each line at the end of the current state of the file.

Generally speaking, **History** is used to trace the change process of a file, while **Blame** is used to view the last editor of each line of the current file.

The history and Blame buttons can be found in the title bar of the file content display of the specific file.
