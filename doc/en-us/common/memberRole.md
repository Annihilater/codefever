# How to choose a member role?

CodeFever has five built-in user roles, namely **visitor**, **supervisor**, **developer**, **maintainer** and **owner**. The permissions of these five types of roles are shown in the attached table at the end of the article.

The five types of roles are specifically described as:

**Guest**: The role with the lowest permissions in the repository, which has only read permissions on all items in the entire repository, and is generally used to set members outside the project to read codes.

**Supervisor**: Has read access to the repository and can follow up the progress of the **merge request**, generally used in the role of QA, tester, project manager, etc. in the project team.

**Developer**: Has read and write permissions for the repository code, can push the code, submit and view **merge requests**. Generally used for project developers.

**Maintainer**: Has basic permissions for repository code and repository management, and can merge and close **merge requests**. It is generally used with the technical manager or technical supervisor of the project.

**Owner**: Has all permissions of the repository.
