# Push a new branch

If the pushed branch does not exist in the remote repository, it will be considered a new branch.

At this point, the push command needs one more parameter **-u** to complete the push of the new branch

For example: when pushing a new branch named **master** to a remote repository named **origin**, the push command should be close to the following text:

> git push -u origin/master
