# What is CodeFever?

# Introduction

CodeFever is a code repository platform under Dandelion that provides more lightweight, efficient and stable R&D and production. The team can carry out research and development work and plan deployment projects more freely.

# The main function

CodeFever provides users with basic Git code hosting, including code online viewing, historical version viewing, Fork, Merge Request, version control, branch protection, member access, and other functions that facilitate management, development, and collaboration.

# Why use CodeFever?

Self-built code hosting system is the choice of most enterprises in the early stage, which requires some preparations, such as: selecting open source software suitable for development scenarios, preparing some storage hardware devices for hosting code, etc.

When preparing for these tasks, it is necessary to have staff who are very familiar with open source software for construction and daily maintenance. It is necessary to purchase some physical or cloud storage servers, and it is necessary to spend some special costs to improve the overall security and stability. These preparations are a large investment cost for the initial stage of the enterprise, so the cloud code repository is the best choice for most companies at this time.

In terms of code storage, the cloud code repository provides high availability and multiple copies, automatic backup, and supports high-speed access; in terms of code security, it provides a complete permission mechanism to reduce the risk of internal members leaking code data.

CodeFever is a code repository platform created by Dandelion for developers, providing more lightweight, efficient and stable R&D and production. The team can carry out research and development work and plan deployment projects more freely.

CodeFever provides the following functions and guarantees:

Adopt multi-copy high-availability architecture, automatic backup without operation and maintenance, and ensure code security.

Exhaustive logging, leaving no commits behind, makes every step effectively traceable.

Cloud high-availability repositorys are more efficient and faster, and Git code management is easier.

Clear branch authority management, with protected branches, improve overall security, and team collaboration is standardized and smooth.

Automatic scanning of incremental code to improve the efficiency of codereview, and process of team member review and approval before merging to improve code quality.

Use MergeRequest's code review mechanism to improve code quality.

Comprehensive and refined authority management, suitable for different personnel to manage repository content.

repository group member permissions are set, and outsourced teams can also use them safely.

IP access settings can be performed on the repository to improve the security level of the code repository.
